## Undergraduate education minor

I am Chair of the Education Minor Committee at the Graduate School of Education (GSE). With support from the UC Office of the President, the GSE has recently launched an [online education minor](https://gse.berkeley.edu/undergraduate-programs-undergraduate-minor) called _Educating for the 21st Century_. The online minor can be completed during the academic year, or during summer school. The minor is also open to non-Berkeley students, who receive a UC Berkeley Education Certificate upon completion of all requirements.

As part of the minor I have created, and currently teach, the online course _Education in a Global World_ (EDUC W142). An introductory video describing the course can be found [here](https://youtu.be/W1Eld66tufs).

I also regularly teach an undergraduate course titled _Education and International Development_ (EDUC 148) which is cross-listed with the [Global Studies](http://globalstudies.berkeley.edu) program, where I am an affiliated faculty member. 

## Qualitative research methods

I regularly teach the graduate level _Introduction to Qualitative Research Methods_ class (EDUC 271B). This class introduces students to qualitative research methods commonly used in the social sciences. It also covers research ethics and human subjects protection issues. This course satisfies the qualitative research methods requirement for the graduate program.

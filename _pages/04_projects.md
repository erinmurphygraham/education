I am currently engaged in three extramurally funded research projects. Several of these projects, as with some of my past work, including the research summarized in my [book](http://www.amazon.com/dp/082651829X), intersect with the _Sistema de Aprendizaje Tutorial_ program ("Tutorial Learning System" or SAT) . SAT is an innovative secondary education program developed by the Colombian non-governmental organization [FUNDAEC](http://www.fundaec.org/en/) in the early 1980s. SAT now operates in several countries across Latin America. 

### Effective Secondary Teaching in Rural Honduran Schools    
Funder: [_ESRC/DFID Raising Learning Outcomes Program_](http://www.esrc.ac.uk/research/international-research/international-development/esrc-dfid-raising-learning-outcomes-in-education-systems-research-programme/). 

In this project, together with collaborators, I am extending my earlier [impact evaluation]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl}}/downloads/published/EMG_EEPA2015.pdf) of the _Sistema de Aprendizaje Tutorial_ program in Honduras.  SAT has a coherent and innovative method of teacher recruitment and training, resource provision for effective teaching, and mechanisms for professional support, accountability, and incentives (see, for example, this [Brookings Institution Study](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/education-plus-development/2015/03/11/getting-millions-to-learn-an-education-revolution-in-rural-communities-of-central-and-south-america/)). ![Image of SAT students farming]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl}}/downloads/SAT_farming_honduras.jpg){:style="float: left;margin-right: 10px;margin-left: 10px;margin-top: 10px;margin-bottom: 10px;"} In examining a comprehensive system of educational innovation, the project contributes to the evidence base for new models of quality, relevant, and accessible secondary education through an in-depth, mixed-methods case study of rural secondary education in Honduras. 

As part of the project we are studying the following:

* What system-wide features make a critical contribution to effective teaching in rural Honduran secondary schools? 
* Which elements of effective teaching contribute to sustained learning gains that are relevant and useful for youth as they transition to adulthood? 

We define “effective teaching” as teaching that leads to both immediate and sustained gains in learning across a range of competencies relevant to successful adulthood.

In June 2016 we completed quantitative and qualitative data collection for this longitudinal study (the first wave of which was fielded in 2008, when students were sixth graders). Now in their early 20s, we hope to be able to look at the ways in which high quality education positively impacts youth. We (myself, my colleague Patrick McEwan at Wellesley College, UCB doctoral students David Torres, Diana Pacheco, Franklin Moreno and Becca Shareff, and research assistants in Honduras) designed research instruments (assessments in Spanish and math, a survey measuring a number of outcomes including education, work, earnings, childbirth, marital status, gender norms, and civic attitudes/participation) and fielded them in a sample of 94 rural villages (47 SAT and 47 villages that have traditional secondary schools known as CEBs or Centros de Educación Básica). In total there are 1,426 youth in our sample. 

We are currently conducting analyses of the quantitative and qualitative datasets, and will be presenting results at conferences in 2017.    

### Ending child marriage through holistic secondary education    
Funder: [_Summit Charitable Foundation_](http://www.summitfdn.org/)

This project extends my earlier work on adolescent girls’ empowerment through alternative secondary education in Honduras, as well as research that examined the ways in which adolescent girls exercise agency in the process of early marriage (e.g., [Murphy-Graham, 2008]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl}}/downloads/published/EMG_GE2008.pdf), [Murphy-Graham and Leal, 2015]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl}}/downloads/published/EMG_CER2015.pdf)  

_Ending Child Marriage through Holistic Secondary Education_ is a Design-Based Research (DBR) study being conducted in tandem with the Summit Foundation’s recent grant to the [Asociación Bayán](http://www.bayanhn.org/home) in Honduras. We are exploring how holistic secondary education can play a role in changing the cultural beliefs and practices in rural Honduran communities where child marriage and early pregnancy are prevalent. DBR is a “methodology designed with and for educators that seeks to increase the impact, transfer, and translation of education research into improved practice” (Anderson and Shattuck, 2012, p. 16). DBR involves partnerships between researchers and practitioners to overcome “some problem or create an improvement in local practice.” In this project, our research team from UC Berkeley (myself and doctoral candidate Diana Pacheco) is working together with coordinators, tutors and students in the Honduran SAT program to research, design, and implement an intervention aimed at reducing child marriage and early pregnancy. We work together with Bayan Association to 1) gain a better understanding of the problems of early marriage in pregnancy in the communities where SAT is being offered and 2) assess the adequacy of the content addressing these issues in the current curriculum; 3) design an intervention to address early marriage and pregnancy. 

### Impact evaluation of the A Ganar Sports-Based Workforce Development Program
Funder: [_USAID/Social Impact_](https://www.usaid.gov)

Even with access to quality education, Honduran youth face tremendous challenges. Many of these challenges stem from lack of economic opportunities and high levels of violence in their communities. In this project we focus on a particularly vulnerable group of youth in Central America (Honduras and Guatemala) that are not studying or working, locally they are known as “ninis” (which comes from the Spanish "neither work nor study"/"ni trabajan ni estudian"). As in my earlier work ([Murphy-Graham and Lample, 2014]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl}}/downloads/published/EMG_IJED2014.pdf)), in this project I extend previous inquiries into how education can promote affiliation, which is one of the central human capabilities proposed by Martha Nussbaum, a key theorist of the capabilities approach to human development. Affiliation means to be “able to live with and towards others, to recognize and show concern for other human beings, and to be able to engage in various forms of social interaction” (Nussbaum, 2011, p. 34). Affiliation also entails having the “bases of self respect and non-humiliation; the ability to be treated as a dignified being whose worth is equal to that of others” (p. 34). If one adopts the notion of “affiliation” as a core capability, it follows that education should cultivate the central capability of affiliation through the development of values including dignity, equality, empathy, and providing opportunities to engage in social interaction. 
	
In Honduras, these values and opportunities are particularly important because of the ways in which violence has deteriorated the social fabric of communities. Honduras has high levels of gang-related violence and one of the highest homicide rates in the world. Youth risk their lives on a daily basis to flee the dangers of their communities, often heading towards Mexico and the United States. My research explores one strategy being implemented in Honduras, funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), to provide a viable alternative to youth between the ages of 16 and 24 that are socially and economically marginalized.  The program, [A Ganar](http://www.partners.net/aganar), (which means "to win" or to "earn" in Spanish) is a “workforce development program wrapped up in a soccer ball”.  In using the metaphor of sports, the program hopes to reach out to young men and women and instill a number of “character skills” (Heckman and Kautz, 2013) including determination, teamwork, perseverance, and respect. We will finish data collection for this project in 2017/2018.
